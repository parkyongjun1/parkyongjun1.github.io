## **Conclusions & Reviews**
- 시간 정보를 이용한 data collection strategy를 제시.

- 구성한 dataset 특성에 맞게 시간 정보를 활용해 self-supervised learning을 수행.

- baseline MoCo v2 대비 더 높은 성능했고, Imagenet pretrain보다 높은 성능을 달성.

- MoCo 모델을 4-batch(모델 4번 통과)처럼 사용함으로써 학습 시간이 오래 걸릴 것으로 판단(논문에서 학습시간 언급 x).

- head 0에서 모든 augmentation을 실제 적용했는지 확인 필요.

- head에 따라 동일 이미지에 대해서도 negative sample로 선정 되는 것이 문제가 없는지 확인 필요.
